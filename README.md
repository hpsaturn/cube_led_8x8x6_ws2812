## Build and install

Please, install first [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/), open source ecosystem for IoT development compatible with **Arduino**, and its command line tools (Windows, MacOs and Linux). Also, you may need to install [git](http://git-scm.com/) in your system. After that please connect your ESP32 board and run the next lines:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hpsaturn/cube_led_8x8x6_ws2812.git
cd cube_led_8x8x6_ws2812 
pio run --target upload
```

## Alternative: WLED

This Cube is compatible with the awesome firmware [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED#readme). You only need install it and load the preset and config from the directory `wled` here, in this repo.
